"""Welcome to the main ioNERDSS function library folder! Here I will give a brief description of each folder and sub folder!
    *Note: Each main folder is named after the file it reads in, except platonic solids since it reads in no files.

    multi_species_hist: reads in multi-species histograms (from NERDSS sim) and then outputs many different graphs
    
    pdb: reads in .pdb files (which is the final position of each atom in a protein complex from a NERDSS sim)
        - read_and_edit: These take in .pdb files, allow you to edit them in many ways and then output them in many ways
            - gen: these are general files called by the main files. These will rarely be used by a user of ioNERDSS
        - size_filter: This takes in a .pdb file, then removes all protein complexes that are too small
            - gen: same as before
    
    platonic_solids: creates different types of platonic solids that can be inputted into NERDSS sim
        - cube/dode/icos/octa/tetra: create that shape
        - gen_platonic: code used by all shapes
    
    restart: reads in the .restart file
    single_species_hist:reads in single-species histograms (from NERDSS sim) and then outputs many different graphs
    transition_matrix: reads in a transition matrix
    xyz: reads in the .xyz file
